# C++ Modules â€“ A Deep Dive into Modern C++

The C++ Modules are a structured series of projects designed to help students master C++ programming, from basic syntax to advanced object-oriented programming concepts. 
These modules act as an intensive introduction to modern C++ and are essential for students transitioning from C or other languages.

* Module 00-01: Basics of C++ syntax, memory management, and differences from C.
* Module 02-03: Object-oriented programming (OOP), encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* Module 04-05: Abstract classes, interfaces, and deeper OOP principles.
* Module 06-07: Casting, containers (like vectors and maps), and algorithmic programming.
* Module 08-09: Smart pointers, file handling, and advanced modern C++ features.

These modules help build a strong foundation for software engineering roles, particularly in performance-critical applications like gaming, finance, and embedded systems
